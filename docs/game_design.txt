Harvesting and scavenging
- early-game acquisition of resources
- trees slowly produce piles of wood around themselves
- berries, herbs, wild grains, mushrooms grow on soil
- cutting down wood is time-consuming, so clearing space for construction is slow and work-intensive
 - cutting down trees produces "timber" piles, which need to be harvested and hauled
 - requires tools to do it effectively and at scale


Wood types
 - poor wood - low-quality wood only useful for firewood
 - wood - wood useful as firewood or for construction
 - hard wood - highly useful for construction and carpentry
 - luxury wood - high-value wood, foolish to burn, great for crafts and carpentry

Construction
Construction materials of different type, made from different materials and heaving different properties
 - Light material
  - Made from (either):
   - Some Timber
   - Few stone (slow)
   - Little steel
  - Easy to build, weak, flammable
 - Heavy material
  - Made from (either)
   - Lots of timber (slow)
   - Some stone
   - Some Steel
   - Concrete?
  - Slow to build, hard, heavy, not flammable
 - Composite material
  - Made from (either)
   - Some Plastics
   - Lots of steel
  - Super-slow to build, hard but light, somewhat flammable
 - Sophisticated materials
  - Made from (either)
   - Lots of plastics
   - Precious metals
   - Components
  - Used as as additive to some constructions

Components
 - Mechanical components
 - Electronic components
